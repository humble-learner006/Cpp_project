## Project guidelines
Posted on: Friday, September 27, 2024 8:25:19 PM CST
Dear all,
I have uploaded a [document](./Doc/Project Guidelines.pdf) detailing the project guidelines,   
which essentially covers the content I discussed in the lecture.
If you weren't present in the lecture, please review the document thoroughly.
Additionally, I have provided two sample project topics from previous semesters.
These examples are intended to give you an idea of what a typical project might entail.
However, please do not feel constrained by these examples; you are encouraged to choose any topic that interests you.  

Here are some additional suggestions on how to select topics and approach your project:  
**Envision the Final Outcome:** Consider the final product you all aim to create. Use your imagination to visualize the ultimate form of   
your program and clearly define your goal. It can be problematic if the whole group has a vague idea and everyone has a different image 
of the final product.  
**Divide the Work:** Break down the project into 5-6 parts based on your group size and assign these parts accordingly. Each member
should then individually focus on their assigned components, ensuring their goals are clear. If there is any confusion, seek clarification 
from your teammates or adjust your project proposal as needed.  
**Ensure Extendability:** Start by developing a small, functional program and then expand upon it. This principle applies to each 
team member's individual component as well. Build your part in a simple, functional manner so it integrates seamlessly with othersâ€™  components.   
You can then refine and enrich it depending on how much time you have.  
**Manage Workload:** The workload for everyone should be comparable to completing 20 exercises from the textbook, which previously 
accounted for 50% of the final grade, similar to this project. This translates to approximately 5-6 hours of work per week, totaling 
60-100 hours per person for the entire project, depending on the importance of this course to you and your personal time management. That's also why the above strategy is desirable.  

I hope you find these suggestions helpful. Enjoy programming!
